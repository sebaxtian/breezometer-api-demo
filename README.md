# BreezoMeter API Demo

Hi, this repo contains a couple of examples to use the [BreezoMeter API](https://docs.breezometer.com/api-documentation/air-quality-api/v2/#air-quality-api-v2) to get data for Air Quality at a specific city or location around the world and save that data into datasets with CSV format.

The main idea is to get historical records, save it into CSV files and post tweets with Air Quality conditions every day in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
